# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
Python implementation of algorithms from Sutton & Barto's book [*Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)*](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)  
Code is mainly the same as this Github repository [reinforcement-learning-an-introduction](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction)  
Due to my laziness, this part of declaration may not always be kept at the top of each file. I may add them to each file later.
